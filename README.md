# Dough

A starting point for a static JavaScript application. Ideal for projects that just require hosting off of Amazon S3. Includes development and production NPM scripts, an easy to understand folder hierarchy, and example code to get started quickly.

## First steps

You'll need [git](https://git-scm.com), [nodejs 6+](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com) installed. Then you'll need to perform these steps.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:meanjim/dough.git
cd dough
npm install -g gulp
npm install
npm start
```

## Production build

```sh
npm run build
```

Check your `/build` folder afterwards and celebrate.
